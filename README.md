My website

_(Well, eventually. This isn't actually the code for my website yet. All of that lives in a private repo, and I'm planning to migrate that to this public one as I have the time.)_


## Colophon

_how the sausage is made_

I'm trying out [eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) this time (instead of Jekyll). So far so good.

The pages are written in markdown, using the [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) libary, and some plugins

* [markdown-it-footnote](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-footnote)
* TBD

I'm using [handlebars](https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js) for simple layout templates.

I don't have any CSS yet, and I'm kinda liking the old-school look of the site at the moment.
