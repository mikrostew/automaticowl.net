Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

[Link to another page](/).

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

### footnotes

Footnotes[^examplecom] should show up correctly[^footnotescom].

# Header 1 ([link](/))

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2 ([link](/))

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

Indicating that something is OK:

@@BLOCK-APPROVE
> Not sure that I would use this much...

Or giving some info:

@@BLOCK-INFO
> **You should note this.**<br>
> Long lines should look right if they go all the way over to the right side of this box and run up against the edge.

Or providing a warning:

@@BLOCK-WARN
> Don't tell me you weren't warned...
>
> This should handle multiple paragraphs too

Or showing an error:

@@BLOCK-ERROR
> **Error! Error! Abandon ship!**
>
> Kidding, it's fine

Or indicating where I took notes from:

@@BLOCK-NOTE
> Notes taken from [some video](https://www.youtube.com) on YouTube

Javascript with syntax highlighting (and file name):

Ruby with syntax highlighting (with text above the code):

@@CODETEXT Some ruby code
```ruby
# make some nice lexed html
source = File.read('/etc/bashrc')
formatter = Rouge::Formatters::HTML.new
lexer = Rouge::Lexers::Shell.new

# Get some CSS
Rouge::Themes::Base16.mode(:light).render(scope: '.highlight')

# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

Some bash with syntax highlighting (no header):
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Count lines of code for the input files

# at least one file should be passed in
if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]
then
  echo_err "No input files given!"
  exit 1

echo "Total lines    : $num_lines"
echo "No empty lines : $num_lines_no_blank"
echo "No comments    : $num_lines_no_comments"
```

Code with no syntax highlighting:

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
$ cat examples.txt
Short lines that don't wrap.
Or shouldn't, anyway.
